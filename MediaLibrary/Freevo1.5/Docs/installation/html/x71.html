>2.2.1. CPU / Motherboard</H2
><P
>The Freevo homepage states that a 400MHz computer should be fine for simple TV viewing and CD/MP3 playback. However, if you would like to watch DVD's, record TV or use the more advanced features of Freevo it is generally accepted that at least a 1GHz CPU is required.

>2.2.2. Video Card</H2
><P
>Without hesitation I would recommend you run like crazy to eBay and purchase a G400 that supports TV out. As documented across the Internet the Matrox G400 is the best supported video card by the frame buffer drivers. 
      </P
><P
>That being said, any card that supports TV out should work with Freevo. Your mileage may vary depending on how nice of a card it is, what type of card it is, and how well the cards are supported by the frame buffer drivers.

>2.2.3. TV Tuner Card</H2
><P
>By far the most widely supported TV tuner cards for linux are the BT8x8 chipsets. A common and reasonably priced ($40.00 at CompUSA at the time of this writing) is the Hauppage WinTV card. If you want to use the TV support in Freevo you must have a TV tuner card.

>2.2.4. Motherboard</H2
><P
>The only requirement for motherboards is that they support DMA. If your motherboard doesn't support the use of DMA then you will need to upgrade. Please note that DMA support is really only required if you are planning to watch DVD's with Freevo.

>2.2.5. CD/DVD/CDRW Drives</H2
><P
>Obviously, you need a DVD drive if you plan on watching DVD movies. If you don't plan on watching DVD movies then any CD or CDRW drive will be sufficient to listen to CD's. I personally use a Samsung DVD/CDRW combo drive, which works great.
