Summary For Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:



Rank the complexity score from A to F, where A stands for the simplest and best score and F the most complex and worst one:

1 - 5	A (low risk - simple block)
6 - 10	B (low risk - well structured and stable block)
11 - 20	C (moderate risk - slightly complex block)
21 - 30	D (more than moderate risk - more complex block)
31 - 40	E (high risk - complex block, alarming)
41+	F (very high risk - error-prone, unstable block)
Here block is used in place of function, method or class.
